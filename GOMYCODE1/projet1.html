        <h2>Animal cruelty facts and stats</h2>
        <h3>What to know about abuse victims and legislative trends</h3>
        <p>The shocking number of animal cruelty cases reported every day is just the tip of the iceberg—most cases are never reported. Unlike violent crimes against people, cases of animal abuse are not compiled by state or federal agencies, making it difficult to calculate just how common they are. However, we can use the information that is available to try to understand and prevent cases of abuse.</p>
<h2>Who abuses animals?</h2>
<p>Cruelty and neglect cross all social and economic boundaries and media reports suggest that animal abuse is common in both rural and urban areas.

    Intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence against people.
    Hoarding behavior often victimizes animals. Sufferers of a hoarding disorder may impose severe neglect on animals by housing far more than they are able to adequately take care of. Serious animal neglect (such as hoarding) is often an indicator of people in need of social or mental health services.
    Surveys suggest that those who intentionally abuse animals are predominantly men under 30, while those involved in animal hoarding are more likely to be women over 60.</p>
<h2>Most common victims</h2>
<p>The animals whose abuse is most often reported are dogs, cats, horses and livestock. Undercover investigations have revealed that animal abuse abounds in the factory farm industry. But because of the weak protections afforded to livestock under state cruelty laws, only the most shocking cases are reported, and few are ever prosecuted.</p>
<h12Organized cruelty</h2>
<p>Dogfighting, cockfighting and other forms of organized animal cruelty go hand in hand with other crimes, and continues in many areas of the United States due to public corruption.

    The HSUS documented uniformed police officers at a cockfighting pit in Kentucky.
    The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has prosecuted multiple cases where drug cartels were running narcotics through cockfighting and dogfighting operations.
    Dozens of homicides have occurred at cockfights and dogfights.
    A California man was killed in a disagreement about a $10 cockfight bet.
    The HSUS’s investigative team combats complacent public officials and has worked with the FBI on public corruption cases in Tennessee and Virginia. In both instances, law enforcement officers were indicted and convicted.</p>
<h2>Correlation with domestic violence</h2>
<p>Data on domestic violence and child abuse cases reveal that a staggering number of animals are targeted by those who abuse their children or spouses.</p>
